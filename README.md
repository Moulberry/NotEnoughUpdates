NotEnoughUpdates (NEU) is a feature rich 1.8.9 Minecraft forge mod for Hypixel Skyblock.

## Active repository

Ever since Moulberry has stopped working on NEU, other contributors have been working on new features and fixes for the mod. If you are interested in contributing yourself, make a pull request to [NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates) to contribute to the prereleases, which eventually will be merged in bulk to [Moulberry/NotEnoughUpdates](https://github.com/Moulberry/NotEnoughUpdates) for major releases.

## Getting Started

#### Installing Forge

1. Run normal Minecraft 1.8.9 and once it reaches the title screen wait about 5 seconds and close it.
2. Install Minecraft **1.8.9** forge from the [forge website](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html)
   - Once you click on the installer you'd like to download, a window will pop up. **Do not click on anything in the middle of your screen**; instead, click on the `skip ad` button towards the top right
3. Open the installer, select install client, and click install
4. When forge is installed, open the Minecraft launcher, go under the `installations tab`, click `new installation`, select the version release `1.8.9-forge1.8.9-11.15.1.xxxx` (it will usually be all the way towards the bottom).
5. Once you are done, run this new installation that you just created. Once it reaches the title screen, wait about 5 seconds and close it.

#### Installing the NotEnoughUpdates mod

1. Download the latest mod [release](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates-REPO/releases). If it says `this file may harm your computer`, click `allow anyways` as all java files will be flagged by Chrome.
2. Add the NEU mod:
   - If you have java installed, double click the file, click `install`
   - If not, press the windows key + R; type `%appdata%`; click on the folder called `.minecraft`; click on the folder called `mods` and drag the mods file in here.
3. Open the Minecraft launcher and run your forge installation you set up earlier.
4. Then, hop onto Skyblock and run the command `/api new`. Your api key is automatically filled out and all features should work.
5. Type `/neu`. If you see the NotEnoughUpdates menu, you have done this correctly!
