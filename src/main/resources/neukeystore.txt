neukeystore.jks
===============

This file should only ever be handled by a `keytool` binary from jdk 1.8u51 or below, as to be compatible with old java versions.

The password to the keystore is `neuneu` and it contains every certificate from jdk 1.8u51 and the Let's Encrypt root CAs.

Example for adding a new certificate:

  ~/.jdks/jdk1.8.0_51/bin/keytool -keystore neukeystore.jks -storepass neuneu -alias ISRGROOTX1 -import -file isrgrootx1.der

Please keep a list of added aliases below:

 - ISRGROOTX1 (Let's Encrypt)
 - ISRGROOTX2 (Let's Encrypt)
 - MSRSAROOT (Microsoft Root CA 2017)
 - DIGIROOTG2 (DigiCert Global Root G2)
