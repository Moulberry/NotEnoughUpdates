/**
 * <h3>TO OTHER MOD AUTHORS THAT WANT TO BUNDLE KOTLIN AND ARE RUNNING INTO CONFLICTS WITH NEU:</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * NEU allows you to stop it from loading Kotlin by specifying one of two properties in the
 * {@link Launch#blackboard}. This needs to be done before {@link #injectIntoClassLoader}, so do it in your Tweakers
 * constructor. Most likely you will not need to do this, since different Kotlin versions rarely contain breaking changes
 * and most people do not use any of the newer features.
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   	<li>
 *      {@code neu.relinquishkotlin.ifbelow}. Set to an int array, like so: {@code [1, 7, 20]}.
 * 			See {@link #BUNDLED_KOTLIN_VERSION}
 *   	</li>
 *  	<li>
 *      {@code neu.relinquishkotlin.always}. If set to {@code true}, will prevent NEU from loading any kotlin.
 *  		Before you use this, consider: are you sure you are always gonna have a more update version of Kotlin than NEU?
 *  		And, even if you are sure, do you really want to block us from updating our Kotlin, after we so graciously allowed
 *  		you to stop us from breaking your mod.
 *  	</li>
 *  	<li>
 *  	 	Additionally, setting the jvm property {@code neu.relinquishkotlin} to 1, will prevent NEU from loading Kotlin.
 *  	</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Sadly the Kotlin stdlib cannot be relocated (and we wouldn't want to do that either, because it would prevent us
 * from interoperating with other Kotlin mods in some ways (for example: reflection)), so in order to minimize conflicts,
 * we allow other mods to stop us from loading Kotlin. Usually this would be handled with a common library provider, but
 * since those come bundled with literal Remote Code Execution, Cosmetics, and unskippable Updates that can just not be
 * considered a good thing by any developer with a conscience nowadays, those are not an option for us. Another option
 * would be a dependency resolution algorithm like Jar-in-Jar, but sadly we have to mod on a 7 year old modding platform,
 * so we have to make due with our crude hack.
 * </p>
